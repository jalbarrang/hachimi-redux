//! Smart training recommendation: score each facility by its projected 評価点
//! (evaluation-point) gain this turn, failure-adjusted and clamped at the player's
//! per-stat targets/caps. Pure logic — no IL2CPP, safe on the render thread.
//!
//! Model (agreed with the user):
//! ```text
//! eval_delta = Σ_stat [ stat_score(min(cur + gain, ceiling)) − stat_score(cur) ]
//!   ceiling = effective_threshold(target, cap)   (0 ⇒ no clamp)
//! p = failure_rate / 100
//! score = eval_delta × (1 − p)                         # EV of the gains
//! if failure_rate > RISK_THRESHOLD_PCT:                # extra risk penalty
//!     loss = eval_cost_of_losing 5 pts on the trained stats + MOOD_DROP_PENALTY
//!     score −= p × loss
//! ```
//!
//! Known v1 limitation: greedy per-turn. It does not value building bonds early for
//! later rainbow payoff, nor cross-turn energy management.
