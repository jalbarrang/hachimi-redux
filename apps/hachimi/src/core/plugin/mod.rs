//! Plugin SDK domain module shared by the host and runtime-loaded plugins.
//! `api` exposes the C ABI vtable, `types` defines shared plugin types,
//! `events` drives host→plugin event dispatch, and `overlay`, `menu`,
//! `notification` own plugin-driven GUI state.
//! `mod.rs` re-exports the public surface used by the rest of core.
