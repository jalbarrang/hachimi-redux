# Agent Guidelines — Hachimi Edge

## Hard Rules

- **Never launch the game.** Do not run `steam://rungameid`, start executables, or invoke any command that launches the game process. Deployment (copying DLLs) is fine; running the game is the user's job.
- **Never kill game processes.** Do not use `taskkill` or equivalent on game processes.
- **Never modify the backup DLL** at `cri_mana_vpx.dll.backup` in the game directory.
