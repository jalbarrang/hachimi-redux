# Agent Instructions

## Code Conventions

- Always run clippy and rust-fmt after writing code.
- Test the code generated and avoid regressions.
- The lesser the code the better maintainability.
    - If a file starts to get bigger, decompose it.

## Hard Rules

- **Never launch the game.** Do not run `steam://rungameid`, start executables, or invoke any command that launches the game process. Deployment (copying DLLs) is fine; running the game is the user's job.
- **Never kill game processes.** Do not use `taskkill` or equivalent on game processes.
- **Never modify the backup DLL** at `cri_mana_vpx.dll.backup` in the game directory.
